The library contains a base charm implements the provider side of the `tls-certificates-interface`
to provide signed certificates from an ACME servers, using [LEGO](https://go-acme.github.io/lego).
It should be used as a base for charms that need to provide TLS certificates.

To get started using the library, you need to fetch the library using `charmcraft`.

```shell
charmcraft fetch-lib charms.lego_base_k8s.v0.lego_client
```

You will also need to add the following library to the charm's dependencies:

- jsonschema
- cryptography
